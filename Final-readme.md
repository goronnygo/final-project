For this project i created an application to view the weather before your trips.
you can view each town or city by state and even worldwide.

In the weather description:
I placed both celsius and fahrenheit for the output temps
a minimum and maximum temperature
and a humidity level

i used google and and open weather for their apis


At the very bottom I placed a clear button to restart the search

<!-- How to use it -->

It's pretty simple, all you do is type in your destination and you'll be provided with the weather below.

If you want to check a different location just press the clear button and restart the search.
